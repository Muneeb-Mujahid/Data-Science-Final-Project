<b>Predicting Heart Disease Using Machine Learning</b></b>

Uses various Python based machine learning tools to build a model that is capable of predicting whether someone has heart disease based on their medical data

<b>Data contains;</b></b>

age - age in years

sex - (1 = male; 0 = female)

cp- chest pain type (0: Typical angina; 1: Atypical angina; 2: Non-angnial pain; 3: Asymptomatic)

trestbps - resting blood pressure (in mm Hg on admission to the hospital)

chol - serum cholestoral in mg/dl

fbs - (fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl) (1 = true; 0 = false)

restecg - resting electrocardiographic results

thalach - maximum heart rate achieved

exang - exercise induced angina (1 = yes; 0 = no)

oldpeak - ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest

slope - the slope of the peak exercise ST segment

ca - number of major vessels (0-3) colored by flourosopy

thal - 1 = normal; 2 = fixed defect; 3 = reversable defect

target - have disease or not (1 = yes, 0 = no)

<b>Preparing the tools</b>

The following tools are going to be used for data analysis, manipulation and modelling:

-pandas

-matplotlib

-numpy

-seaborn

-scikit-learn

<b>Predictive Machine Learning Models</b></b>

-Random Forest Classifier

-DecisionTreeClassifier

-Logistic Regression

-KNeighbors Classifier

<b>Conclusion</b>

Best result was achieved by using Random Forest Classification Model for this predictive analysis.
